Django ready-to-deploy on Google App Engine
===========================================

This project is meant to allow people to have a base on deploying their django apps without having to do all the work I did, they should read the official django docs about NoSQL databases and django-norel, but in theory, with this they can start to work as usual on it.

This version uses django-1.4 at the moment
